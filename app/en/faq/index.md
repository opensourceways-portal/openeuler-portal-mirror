### 12. What is A-Ops?

A-Ops is an OS-oriented O&M platform that provides intelligent O&M solutions covering data collection, health check, fault diagnosis, and fault rectification. The A-Ops project includes the following sub-projects: Gala (fault detection), X-diagnosis (fault locating), and Apollo (vulnerability rectification).

### 13. What capabilities does secGear provide?

secGear provides:

- Architecture compatibility: It masks differences between various SDK APIs by sharing the same set of source code across multiple architectures.
- Easy development: The development tools and general-purpose security components allow users to focus on services, significantly improving development efficiency.
- High performance: The switchless feature improves interaction performance between the rich execution environment (REE) and trusted execution environment (TEE) by more than 10-fold in typical scenarios, such as frequent REE-TEE interactions and big data interaction.

### 14. What security technologies are used in AI for OS?

Vulnerability discovery: Automatic vulnerability discovery is crucial to OS security. It identifies defects using code analysis, fuzz testing, or both. Traditional fuzz testing tools are often both random and blind when it comes to generating and selecting seeds, mutations, testing, and feedback. In addition, code analysis relies on defect pattern libraries, which need to manually be built by experts. AI improves this by detecting patterns in defect code datasets to enhance the precision and efficiency of vulnerability identification.

Intrusion detection: Modern security threats, such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APT), are sophisticated and persistent. Traditional security defenses often fail against unknown threats. AI enhances security by deeply analyzing data, extracting key features from high-dimensional datasets, and identifying system abnormalities effectively. This improves the accuracy and timeliness of attack blocking methods, such as in abnormal traffic and side-channel attack detection.。

### 15. What are the advantages of the multi-level scheduling framework provided by openEuler?

openEuler's multi-level scheduling framework allows you to choose the most suitable scheduling model for your needs and provides the following advantages:

- Higher flexibility and portability compared to traditional process/thread scheduling models.
- Faster model switching and scheduling thanks to the use of lightweight scheduling models.

### 16. How does openEuler ensure security?

openEuler ensures security by providing the following comprehensive security features:

- Authenticity protection
- Integrity protection
- Confidentiality protection

### 17. What security isolation technologies does openEuler provide for the industrial sector?

- Service isolation: Isolates potentially vulnerable services from known sources to minimize the impact of attacks on other system components.
- Code restriction: Limits code from untrusted sources to reduce potential harm to other system components.

### 18. What does "noise" in the openEuler operating system refer to?

Operating system noise includes non-application computing tasks executed during service running, such as:

- System/User-mode daemon processes
- Interrupt processing
- Processes in user mode or kernel
- Memory management and scheduling overhead
- Non-computing tasks in service applications (e.g., monitoring logs and thread communication)
- Resource competition (e.g., cache misses and page faults)

### 19. Where can I find common repo sources for openEuler?

You can find sorted and classified repo sources for various openEuler versions on the [openEuler Forum](https://forum.openeuler.org/t/topic/768).

### 20. When I install openEuler directly onto the second drive **sdb**, the system fails to start. How can I resolve this?

Installing openEuler on the second drive (**sdb**) results in both the MBR and GRUB defaulting to installation on **sdb**. The following two situations may occur:

- If the first drive **sda** contains a complete operating system, the system will boot from **sda**.
- If the first drive **sda** does not have a complete operating system, it may cause boot failure.

Both scenarios occur because the BIOS usually loads the bootloader from the first drive **sda**. If openEuler is not installed on **sda**, it will result in a boot failure.

This problem can be solved by either:

- During installation, when selecting the drive (whether the first or both drives), specify to install the bootloader on the first drive **sda**.
- After the system is installed, if your BIOS allows selecting the boot drive, you can modify the BIOS boot order and then reboot the system.

### 21. If openEuler enters emergency mode upon boot, what steps should I take next?

If the openEuler enters emergency mode upon boot.

![fig](https://docs.openeuler.org/zh/docs/24.03_LTS/docs/Installation/figures/zh-cn_image_0229291264.jpg)

It indicates issues such as file system corruption causing drive mounting failures, overpressured I/O leading to drive mounting timeout \(threshold: 90s\), or anomalies like unexpected power-off or low I/O performance of drives.
To solve this issue:

1. Log in to openEuler as the **root** user.
2. Check and restore files by using the file system check \(fsck\) tool, and reboot openEuler.

    >![fig](https://docs.openeuler.org/zh/docs/24.03_LTS/docs/Installation/public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE**
    
     >The fsck tool checks and maintains inconsistent file systems. In case of power-off or drive issues, fsck commands can be used to check file systems. Run the `fsck.ext3 -h` and `fsck.ext4 -h` commands to view the usage instructions for fsck.

To cancel drive mounting timeouts, add  **x-systemd.device-timeout=0** to the **`etc/fstab`** file. For example:

```sh
#
# /etc/fstab
# Created by anaconda on Mon Sep 14 17:25:48 2015
#
# Accessible filesystems, by reference, are maintained under '/dev/drive'
# See man pages fstab(5), findfs(8), mount(8) and/or blkid(8) for more info
#
/dev/mapper/openEuler-root / ext4 defaults,x-systemd.device-timeout=0 0 0
UUID=afcc811f-4b20-42fc-9d31-7307a8cfe0df /boot ext4 defaults,x-systemd.device-timeout=0 0 0
/dev/mapper/openEuler-home /home ext4 defaults 0 0
/dev/mapper/openEuler-swap swap swap defaults 0 0
```

### 22. What should I do when openEuler fails to reinstall due to drive failure caused by inactivated logical volume groups?

Before reinstalling openEuler, any inactivated logical volume groups must be restored to a normal state or clear them to avoid exceptions during the reinstallation process. For example:

- Restore the logical volume group.

    1. Run the following command to clear the activation status of the volume group to ensure that the error message "Can't open /dev/sdc exclusively mounted filesystem" is not displayed:

       ```sh
        vgchange -a n testvg32947
       ```

    2. Run the following command to recreate a physical volume based on the backup file:

        ```sh
        pvcreate --uuid JT7zlL-K5G4-izjB-3i5L-e94f-7yuX-rhkLjL --restorefile /etc/lvm/backup/testvg32947 /dev/sdc
        ```

    3. Run the following command to restore the volume group information:

        ```sh
        vgcfgrestore testvg32947
        ```

    4. Run the following command to reactivate the logical volume group:

        ```sh
         vgchange -ay testvg32947
        ```

- Clear the logical volume group.
Run the following commands:

    ```sh
    vgchange -a n testvg32947
    vgremove -y testvg32947
    ```

### 23. What should I do if an error occurs when selecting the installation source?

If you encounter the message "Error checking software selection," it may indicate that certain software package dependencies are not met. Please ensure the installation source is valid. If not, consider switching to an alternative source.

### 24. How do I enable the kdump service?

Reserved memory is necessary for running the kdump kernel. If the output of `systemctl status kdump` is "No memory reserved for crash kernel", follow the steps below to reserve it.

![](https://docs.openeuler.org/zh/docs/24.03_LTS/docs/Installation/figures/zh-cn_image_0229291280.png)

1. Add **crashkernel=1024M, high** to **/boot/efi/EFI/openEuler/grub.cfg** (see the table below for details).
2. Restart the system to apply the modification.
3. Run `systemctl status kdump` to check the kdump status. If "active" is displayed in the output, as shown in the following figure, the kdump service is enabled.

![](https://docs.openeuler.org/zh/docs/24.03_LTS/docs/Installation/figures/zh-cn_image_0229291272.png)

**crashkernel** values
| Parameter                                 | Description                                                                                                                  | Default Value                           | Remarks                                                                                                                                              |

| crashkernel=X@Y                           | Reserves _X_ memory starting from address _Y_ for kdump.                                                                     | None                                    | Ensure the _X_ memory starting from address _Y_ is not reserved for other modules.                                                                   |
| crashkernel=X,high                        | Reserves 256 MB physical memory for kdump if the physical memory is less than 4 GB, and _X_ physical memory if 4 GB or more. | None; recommended value: **1024M,high** | Ensure continuous 256 MB memory for physical memory under 4 GB, and _X_ continuous memory for 4 GB or more. Actual reserved memory: 256 MB + _X_.    |
| crashkernel=X,low <br> crashkernel=Y,high | Reserve _X_ physical memory for kdump if the physical memory is less than 4 GB, and _Y_ physical memory if 4 GB or more.     | None                                    | Ensure continuous _X_ physical memory for physical memory under 4 GB, and continuous _Y_ memory for 4 GB or more. Actual reserved memory: _X_ + _Y_. |

### 25. Why can't I select a single drive for openEuler installation when multiple drives form a logical volume?

It is likely you have encountered the following error.

![](https://docs.openeuler.org/zh/docs/24.03_LTS/docs/Installation/figures/Configuration_error_prompt.png)

This occurs because the drive is part of a logical volume. Modifying one drive can corrupt the entire volume. openEuler prevents OS installation on such drives and shows an error message.

To use the drive, delete the volume group corresponding to the logical volume first:

1. Press **Ctrl**+**Alt**+**F2** to switch to the CLI and run `vgs` to find the volume group, for example, **euleros**.
    ![](https://docs.openeuler.org/zh/docs/24.03_LTS/docs/Installation/figures/zh-cn_image_0231657950.png)
2. Run `vgremove euleros` to delete the volume group.
3. Run `systemctl restart anaconda` to restart the system for the modification to take effect.
    >![fig](https://docs.openeuler.org/zh/docs/24.03_LTS/docs/Installation/public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE**

    >You can also press **Ctrl**+**Alt**+**F6** to return to the GUI and click **Refresh** in the lower right corner to update the storage configuration.

### 26. What should I do if I cannot install openEuler on an x86 physical machine due to the BIOS security boot option?

When you install openEuler on an x86 machine and the BIOS setting for secure boot is enabled (which is usually disabled by default), the system might get stuck on the "no bootable device" screen, as shown below, halting installation.

![](https://docs.openeuler.org/zh/docs/24.03_LTS/docs/Installation/figures/No-bootable-device.png)

This occurs because, with secure boot activated, the mainboard checks the digital signatures of the bootloader and OS. If they are not signed with the right private key, the built-in public key of the mainboard will prevent them from running.

To proceed with the installation, disable secure boot:

1. Press **F11** as the system starts up and input the password **Admin@9000** to enter the BIOS.

    ![](https://docs.openeuler.org/zh/docs/24.03_LTS/docs/Installation/figures/BIOS.png)
2. Select **Administer Secure Boot**.

    ![](https://docs.openeuler.org/zh/docs/24.03_LTS/docs/Installation/figures/security.png)
3. Set **Enforce Secure Boot** to **Disabled**.

    ![](https://docs.openeuler.org/zh/docs/24.03_LTS/docs/Installation/figures/select.png)
4. Save the changes and exit. You should now be able to install openEuler successfully.

### 27. How should I address the appearance of "pmie_check failed in /usr/share/pcp/lib/pmie" in the "messages" logs following the openEuler installation with the "Server - Performance tools" software option?

The Anaconda installer, used during openEuler installation, cannot install SELinux policy modules within its chroot environment. Consequently, when the "Server - Performance tools" option installs PCP-related software packages, including `pcp-selinux`, the necessary SELinux policy module is not applied, resulting in an error.
To resolve this issue, execute one of the following commands after installing and restarting openEuler:

- Install the pcpupstream SELinux policy module directly:

 ```
 # /usr/libexec/pcp/bin/selinux-setup /var/lib/pcp/selinux install "pcpupstream"
 ```

 - Reinstall the pcp-selinux package:
 ```
 # sudo dnf reinstall pcp-selinux
 ```

### 28. What should I do if the openEuler installation fails after I select two drives that already have an OS installed, and then customize the partitions?

If there are two drives with an OS already installed, selecting the first drive for partitioning and then canceling, followed by selecting the second drive and partitioning, will lead to installation failure.

![](https://docs.openeuler.org/zh/docs/24.03_LTS/docs/Installation/figures/cancle_disk.png)

![](https://docs.openeuler.org/zh/docs/24.03_LTS/docs/Installation/figures/custom_paratition.png)

This is because frequent operations can corrupt drive information. You are advised to directly select the target drive for partitioning. If you must cancel and reselect, it is recommended that the installation process be started from the beginning.

### 29. What should I do if kdump cannot generate **vmcore** on a physical machine with an LSI MegaRAID card?

After kdump is deployed, the system fails to generate a **vmcore** file following a kernel crash, either triggered manually (using `echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger`) or due to a system fault. While kdump attempts to boot the second kernel, the MegaRAID driver throws error "BRCM Debug mfi stat 0x2d, data len requested/completed 0x200/0x0", as shown in the image below.

![](https://docs.openeuler.org/zh/docs/24.03_LTS/docs/Installation/figures/Megaraid_IO_Request_uncompleted.png)

The issue stems from the default **reset_devices** boot parameter. When the second kernel boots, it triggers a device reset as part of its initialization. This reset operation can cause the MegaRAID card or the connected drives to enter an error state. Consequently, when kdump tries to write the **vmcore** file to the drives managed by the MegaRAID card, it encounters errors, preventing the **vmcore** generation.

To resolve this issue, you need to remove the **reset_devices** parameter from the boot configuration of the second kernel:

1. Open the kdump configuration file **/etc/sysconfig/kdump**.
2. Locate the line where the kernel boot parameters are defined.
3. Remove the **reset_devices** parameter.
4. Save the changes.

![](https://docs.openeuler.org/zh/docs/24.03_LTS/docs/Installation/figures/reset_devices.png)

By removing the **reset_devices** parameter, you prevent the device reset operation during the second kernel boot process. This, in turn, avoids the MegaRAID driver error related to incomplete I/O requests, allowing kdump to successfully generate the **vmcore** file.

### 30. Why does the Raspberry Pi fail to start after I write the openEuler image to the SD card?

This could be due to:

1. Incomplete image. Verify the integrity of the downloaded image.

2. Corruption during image writing, especially on Windows. Try writing it on another OS.

### 31. Why can't I connect to Wi-Fi using the `nmcli` command?

If you encounter the error message "Error: Connection activation failed: (7) Secrets were required, but not provided," it indicates that the password is missing in the `nmcli dev wifi connect SSID password PWD` command. To resolve this issue, ensure that the password is included in the command. If the password contains special characters, remember to enclose it in single quotation marks. If this solution does not work, you can also try using the nmtui utility.

1. Run `nmtui` to enter the text-based user interface (TUI) of nmtui.
2. Select **Edit a connection** and press **Enter** to open the network connection editing window.
3. Select **Add** and press **Enter** to add a connection.
4. Select **Wi-Fi** then **Create** to configure Wi-Fi information.
5. Configure the following fields. Other fields are optional.
    - **Profile name**: name of the Wi-Fi connection
    - **Device**: NIC to use for the connection (enter **wlan0**)
    - **SSID**: SSID of the Wi-Fi network to connect
    - **Security**: Wi-Fi encryption mode (select one as required, for example, **WPA & WPA2 Personal**)
    - **Password**: password of the Wi-Fi network
6. After creating the connection, select **Back** to go back to the TUI home page.
7. Select **Activate a connection** and press **Enter**.
8. The Wi-Fi connection will be marked with **\*** if activated. If not, move the cursor to the connection, then select **Activate**. Once the connection is activated, select **Back** to go back to the nmtui TUI home page.
9. Select **Quit** then **OK** to exit nmtui.

### 32. How do I correctly install TensorFlow and related packages?

TensorFlow 2.12.1 installation may fail if dependencies are not updated to support it. Manually install the dependencies as follows:

1. Run `yumdownloader python3-tensorflow` to download the TensorFlow RPM package.
2. Run `rpm -ivh --nodeps python3-tensorflow` to install the package.
3. Install dependencies of TensorFlow:
    1. Use `pip3` for some dependencies: `pip3 install tensorflow-estimator==2.12.0 keras==2.12.0 protobuf==3.20.3`
    2. Use `yum` for other dependencies: `yum install python3-termcolor python3-future python3-numpy python3-six python3-astunparse python3-google-pasta python3-opt-einsum python3-typing-extensions python3-wrapt python3-h5py python3-grpcio python3-absl-py python3-flatbuffers python3-gast`
4. Use `yum` to install related packages, for example, `yum install python-keras-rl2`.

### 33. Does openEuler support Btrfs, bcachefs, and ZFS?

openEuler currently supports Btrfs but it's worth noting that Btrfs support may change in the future due to relatively low user engagement.
